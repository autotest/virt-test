Drop your test scripts into this directory.
Make them executable, and with no extension.

The test scripts will run unmodified, with
no external context, so make them in a way
that they don't require that extra context.

An example of such a script could be:

#!/bin/sh
true

Using the option --run-dropin, virt-test
will run each one of those scripts and,
if they return 0, they will PASS, if they
return != 0, they will fail.
