Links with downloadable images for virt tests
---------------------------------------------

This is a central location that we aim to keep
up to date with locations of iso files that
might be needed for testing.

Update: Now we have a central location to define
such downloads. In the source tree:

::

    shared/download.d/

Contains a bunch of .ini files, each one with
download definitions. It is expected that this
will be more up to date than this page. You can
see the available downloads and download the files
using:


::

    tools/download_manager.py
