image\_size
===========

Description
-----------

Sets the size of image files. This applies to images creation and also
validation tests (when checking that a image was properly created
according to what was requested).

By default the image size is set to 10G:

::

    image_size = 10G

But a VM can have other drives, backed by other image files (or block
devices), with different sizes:

::

    # Tests
    variants:
        - block_hotplug: install setup image_copy unattended_install.cdrom
            images += " stg"
            boot_drive_stg = no
            image_name_stg = storage
            image_size_stg = 1G
