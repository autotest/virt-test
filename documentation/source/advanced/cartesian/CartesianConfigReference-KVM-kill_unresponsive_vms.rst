kill\_unresponsive\_vms
=======================

Description
-----------

Configures whether VMs that are running, but do not have a responsive
session (for example via SSH), should be destroyed (of course, not
`gracefully <kill_vm_gracefully>`_) during post processing.

This behavior is enabled by default. To turn it off and leave
unresponsive VMs lying around (usually **not** recommended):

::

    kill_unresponsive_vms = no
