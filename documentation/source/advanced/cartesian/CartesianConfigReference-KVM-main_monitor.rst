main\_monitor
=============

Description
-----------

Sets the default monitor for a VM, meaning that when a test accesses the
**monitor** property of a **VM** class instance, that one monitor will
be returned.

Usually a VM will have a single monitor, and that will be a regular
Human monitor:

::

    main_monitor = humanmonitor1

If a **main\_monitor** is not defined, the **monitor** property of a
**VM** class instance will assume that the first monitor set in the
`monitors <monitors>`_ list is the main monitor.
