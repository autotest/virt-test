image\_format
=============

Description
-----------

Sets the format of the backing image file for a given drive.

The value of this configuration key is usually passed verbatim to image
creation commands. It's worth noticing that QEMU has support for many
formats, while virt-test currently plays really well only with
**qcow2** and **raw**.

You can also use **vmdk**, but it's considered 'not supported', at least
on image conversion tests.

To set the default image format:

::

    image_format = qcow2

To set the image format for another image:

::

    # Tests
    variants:
        - block_hotplug: install setup image_copy unattended_install.cdrom
            images += " stg"
            image_format_stg = raw
