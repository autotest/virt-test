qxl\_dev\_nr
============

Description
-----------

Sets the number of display devices available through
`SPICE <http://spice-space.org/faq>`_. This is only valid when
`qxl <qxl>`_ is set.

The default configuration enables a single display device:

::

    qxl_dev_nr = 1

Note that due to a limitation in the current Autotest code (see
`client/virt/kvm\_vm.py <https://github.com/autotest/autotest/blob/master/client/virt/kvm_vm.py>`_)
this setting is only applied when the QEMU syntax is:

::

    # qemu -qxl 2

and not applied when the syntax is:

::

    # qemu -vga qxl
