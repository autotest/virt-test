Welcome to Virt Test's documentation!
=====================================

``virt-test`` is a suite of tests made to exercise different linux virtualization
hypervisors and related tools. Although many people make this mistake, *this
test suite is not autotest*. Autotest is a larger test framework on which
``virt-test`` is built.

If you need information about autotest, `you should check out its project
page <http://autotest.github.io>`_.
