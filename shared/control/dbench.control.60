dbench is one of our standard kernel stress tests.  It produces filesystem
load like netbench originally did, but involves no network system calls.
Its results include throughput rates, which can be used for performance
analysis.

More information on dbench can be found here:
http://samba.org/ftp/tridge/dbench/README

Currently it needs to be updated in its configuration. It is a great test for
the higher level I/O systems but barely touches the disk right now.
