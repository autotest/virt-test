README for lmbench 2alpha8 net release.

To run the benchmark, you should be able to say:

        cd src
        make results

If you want to see how you did compared to the other system results
included here, say

        make see

Be warned that many of these benchmarks are sensitive to other things
being run on the system, mainly from CPU cache and CPU cycle effects.
So make sure your screen saver is not running, etc.

It's a good idea to do several runs and compare the output like so

        make results
        make rerun
        make rerun
        make rerun
        cd Results && make LIST=<your OS>/*
