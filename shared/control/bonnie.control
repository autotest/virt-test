Bonnie is a benchmark which measures the performance of Unix file system
operations. Bonnie is concerned with identifying bottlenecks; the name is a
tribute to Bonnie Raitt, who knows how to use one.

For more info, see http://www.textuality.com/bonnie/

This benchmark configuration run generates sustained write traffic
of 35-50MB/s of .1MB writes to just one disk.  It appears to have a
sequential and a random workload. It gives profile measurements for:
throughput, %CPU rand seeks per second. Not sure if the the CPU numbers
are trustworthy.
