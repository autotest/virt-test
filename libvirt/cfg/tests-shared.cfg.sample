# Modify/comment the following lines if you wish to modify the paths of the
# image files, ISO files or qemu binaries.
#
# As for the defaults:
# * qemu and qemu-img are expected to be found under /usr/bin/qemu-kvm and
#   /usr/bin/qemu-img respectively.
# * All image files are expected under /var/tmp/virt_test/images/
# * All install iso files are expected under /var/tmp/virt_test/isos/
# * The parameters cdrom_unattended, floppy, kernel and initrd are generated
#   by LIBVIRT autotest, so remember to put them under a writable location
#   (for example, the cdrom share can be read only)
