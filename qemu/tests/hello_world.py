    QEMU 'Hello, world!' test

    1) Boot the main vm, or just grab it if it's already booted.
    2) Echo "Hello, world!" in guest and get the output.
    3) Compare whether the return matches our expectations.
    4) Send a monitor command and log its output.
    5) Verify whether the vm is running through monitor.
    6) Echo "Hello, world!" in the host using shell.
    7) Compare whether the return matches our expectations.
    8) Get a sleep_time parameter from the config file and sleep
       during the specified sleep_time.

    This is a sample QEMU test, so people can get used to some of the test APIs.

    :param test: QEMU test object.
    :param params: Dictionary with the test parameters.
    :param env: Dictionary with test environment.
