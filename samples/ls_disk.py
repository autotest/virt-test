"""
Shows all existing disk partitions.

This test requires test-provider to be qemu.

Try this test without config, than put ls_disk.cfg into $tests/cfg/ directory
and see the difference.
Additionally you might put ls_disk_v2.cfg into $tests/cfg/ directory and
execute ls_disk_v2 test (which also uses this script!) and watch for even
bigger differences.
