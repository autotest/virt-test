# As for the defaults:

#   /usr/bin/qemu-img respectively.

# * All install iso files are expected under /var/tmp/virt_test/isos/
# * The parameters cdrom_unattended, floppy, kernel and initrd are generated
#   by LIBVIRT autotest, so remember to put them under a writable location
#   (for example, the cdrom share can be read only)
